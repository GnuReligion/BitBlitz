Silly game demonstrates how to use a PCF8574 to read a button, and show a LED on the same line.

This is all hand-soldered, using a double sided 5x7cm perfboard.
Using an attiny85, for its lack of pins, and soft i2c.

Had called this "LightsOut" but that repo name is already taken on Github.  Oh well.
Demo of the game on YT, pileofstuff's Mailbag Monday 167, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57yn3J7gcEk

Very minimal schematic ... There are pullups on the SDA/SCL lines, of course.
